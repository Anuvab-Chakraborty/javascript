# JavaScript Basics Repository

Hello everyone! In this repository, I've documented all the essential concepts you need to know about the basics of JavaScript. I mainly followed the fantastic tutorials from CodeWithHarry. After completing the series, I plan on going through "Namaste JavaScript" as well and will be adding those classes with my notes here too!

I hope this compilation helps you to revise all the necessary concepts required for interviews.

- Thanking Anuvab.

## Introduction

JavaScript is a powerful scripting language that is widely used for web development. It provides dynamic functionality to websites and enables interactivity. Understanding JavaScript is crucial for any aspiring web developer.

## Variables and Data Types

In JavaScript, variables are used to store data, and data types define the type of data a variable can hold. Learn about different data types and how to declare variables.

## Operators

JavaScript supports various operators for performing operations on variables and values. Get familiar with arithmetic, assignment, comparison, and logical operators.

## Control Statements

Control statements such as if-else, switch, while, and for loops allow you to control the flow of your program. Mastering these statements is essential for writing efficient code.

## Functions

Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. Discover how to create functions, pass arguments, and return values.

## Arrays

Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable. Explore how to work with arrays, perform array operations, and use array methods.

## Objects

Objects are collections of key-value pairs and are fundamental to JavaScript. Learn how to create and manipulate objects to organize data efficiently.

## Classes

ES6 introduced classes, making object-oriented programming more structured in JavaScript. Understand how to create classes and work with inheritance.

## Asynchronous JavaScript

Asynchronous JavaScript allows non-blocking execution of code, essential for handling events and making API calls.

## DOM Manipulation

The Document Object Model (DOM) allows you to interact with HTML elements. Learn how to access and modify the DOM to build dynamic web applications.

## Event Handling

Handling events is crucial for creating interactive web pages. Learn how to attach event listeners to respond to user actions.

## AJAX and Fetch API

AJAX enables you to update parts of a web page without reloading the whole page. The Fetch API simplifies making network requests.

## ES6+ Features

ES6 introduced many new features, such as arrow functions, template literals, and destructuring. Explore these modern JavaScript features.

## Module System

JavaScript modules help organize code and promote reusability. Understand how to create and use modules effectively.

Happy coding!
